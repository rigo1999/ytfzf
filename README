ytfzf
-----
CLI to search and stream YouTube videos


About
-----
This script is a stripped down version of pystardust's ytfzf, a CLI tool to
search and stream YouTube videos using fzf and youtube-dl. Original source
code: https://github.com/pystardust/ytfzf

All nonessential features of the original script were removed (about 95% of the
code). Only the searching and streaming functionalities where preserved. Why?
Because I don't like having features I don't use.


Installation
------------
Just copy the script to a folder that is present in your path or run:

    # make install


Usage
-----
To use ytfzf, simply run:

    $ ytfzf [QUERY]

where QUERY is either nothing or a set of search terms to look up on YouTube.
If no search terms are specified, the videos from YouTube's homepage will be
fetched. You can pass the cookie 'VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE' as an argument to the
cURL command to obtain video recommendations from YouTube based on what you've
watched before. The value for this cookie can be found with the developer tools
found in most browsers.


Dependencies
------------
- fzf
- youtube-dl
- jq
- mpv (optional)
